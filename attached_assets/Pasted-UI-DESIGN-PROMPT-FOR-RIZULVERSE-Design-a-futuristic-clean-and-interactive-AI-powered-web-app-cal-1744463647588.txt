UI DESIGN PROMPT FOR “RIZULVERSE”
Design a futuristic, clean, and interactive AI-powered web app called “Rizulverse”.
The layout should have a top navigation bar with tabs for switching between 3 immersive modules:

Startup Lab – an AI business pitch validator

Design Roast – an AI image critic zone

Time Portal – a chat interface with "Past Me", "Present Me", and "Future Me"

Use a modern dark/light theme toggle, clean layouts, soft shadows, and floating glassmorphism panels.

Would you like me to:

Generate mockup wireframes or layout code for these sections?

Build a base React app with tabbed routing & starter layout?

Drop in GSAP/Framer animation snippets for these blocks?

Let me know your starting realm again:
Startup Lab, Design Roast, or Time Portal — and I’ll prep the code for that module.
