🔧 Fix the Chatbot (Bulb Icon)
Problem:
The current chatbot only shows a hover tooltip — no true interactivity.

✅ Upgrade Plan:
Convert the bulb icon into a clickable floating AI Assistant bubble (bottom-right).

On click: open a side panel modal or bottom drawer with:

🌱 Contextual quick prompts (e.g., “Suggest a startup”, “Give roast tips”, “Ask Future Me something”)

🗣️ A hardcoded or AI-powered small assistant that can offer:

Suggestions

Easter eggs

Motivational messages

Navigation help (like “Go to Design Roast?”)

UX Tip: Animate the bulb glow when idle (slow pulse), brighter when active.
