 1. 🔐 User Login Flow (Google Auth Required)
🔧 What to Build:
Firebase Authentication via Google (or Supabase if preferred)

A login modal that appears when the app loads or on protected action

After login, store:

UID

Name

Profile Picture

Email

Last accessed product

🔑 Benefits:
Users can save chat history, roast results, startup ideas

Prevents anonymous spamming

🧠 2. 👤 Profile + Account Settings
🧩 UI:
Avatar bubble in navbar → dropdown with:

View Profile

Edit Display Name

Toggle theme (dark/light)

Logout

💾 Store in DB:
users table: uid, email, name, avatar, bio, joined_at

Optional: user type (e.g. early tester, builder)

💬 3. 💡 Chatbot Tutorial for Each Section
🎯 Purpose:
When a user enters Startup Lab, Design Roast, or Time Portal, show a contextual “How to Use This” chat guide inside the AI assistant bubble.

Example for Startup Lab:
css
Copy
Edit
💡 Welcome to Startup Lab!
Here you can pitch a startup idea and receive:
✅ Honest feedback
✅ Tech stack suggestions
✅ Competitor scan
Type your idea and hit "Analyze".
Implementation:
On tab load (if first time or toggled): assistantMessageQueue.push(tutorialMsg)

Store tutorial shown state in localStorage or DB per user

🔮 4. Time Portal – Make It Smart, Emotionally-Aware
👁 Current Problem:
Responses are generic. Users don’t know what context is used.

✅ Fix Plan:
a. Ask Users at First:
Add a modal on first visit to Time Portal asking:

“Let’s set the timeline...”

"What year is your past self from?" → e.g., 2019

"What year do you imagine your future self?" → e.g., 2032

Store in localStorage or DB.

b. Dynamic Prompt Example:
js
Copy
Edit
function buildTimePrompt(userInput, persona, year) {
  switch (persona) {
    case 'PAST':
      return `You are Rizul from ${year}, still a student, anxious about the future. Respond reflectively to: "${userInput}"`;
    case 'PRESENT':
      return `You are Rizul in the current time, self-aware, honest, grounded. Respond to: "${userInput}"`;
    case 'FUTURE':
      return `You are Rizul from the year ${year}. You've succeeded in AI, startups, and mentoring. Speak with wisdom. User says: "${userInput}"`;
  }
}
c. Add Persona Flair:
🟥 Past Me: Avatar with "P", sad/humble tones

🟦 Present Me: Balanced responses, tactically supportive

🟩 Future Me: Wise, goal-driven, inspiring

🧪 5. Startup Lab – Fix Intelligence
✍️ Problem:
Responses are generic, non-contextual.

✅ Solution:
Enhance prompt before sending to Gemini:

js
Copy
Edit
"You are a brutally honest VC and AI tech advisor. Analyze the following startup idea on 4 fronts:
1. Originality / Market Gap
2. MVP Tech Stack
3. Monetization Strategy
4. Top 2 Competitors"
Also allow selecting tone: 🧠 Analytical / 🧨 Blunt / 🤝 Supportive

🎨 6. Design Roast – Add Real Roast Logic
Suggestions:
Roast card should show:

Humor headline: “Gradient crimes detected!”

Serious tips: “Consider simplifying your CTA hierarchy”

Add dropdown:

Roast Level: Mild / Honest / Savage

Optional:

Let user type what kind of feedback they want: “Focus on layout”, “Typography only”
